# 3DRM-Plugin
Cura plugin for 3DRM
Takes an encrypted STL file in the .leo format, decrypts it on the server and opens it in cura.
Unfinished and abandoned, was supposed to include a login feature, never finished as it proved unfeasible to prevent users from just downloading the stl file from cura once decrypted, defeating the purpose of the project, still useful as practise.
